```Manifest:``` This file contains the configuration parameters of the project such as permissions, services and additional libraries. A manifest file also provides information to the OS and Google Play store about your app.

```Java:``` Android Studio creates a Java file with skeleton code that you can modify. It opens the file in the Code Editor. In my app I have all the java classes there, I have the login MainActivity class.

```Res:```The res file contains all non-code resources, such as XML layouts, UI strings, and bitmap images, divided into corresponding sub-directories

 > ↳ ```Drawable:```The drawable folder holds all the images for your project. In my case I have the lock images, the email images, all there.
  
  > ↳ ```Layout:```The layout folder holds all the XML layout files for your projects. Here I have the activity_main.xml
  
  > ↳ ```Mipmap:```The mipmap folder holds the icon image for your apps launcher. These should be only as large as necessary to support the devices you want to target for your app. 
  
  > ↳ ```Values:```Values folder is used to store the values for the resources that are used in many Android projects to include features of color, styles, dimensions etc.
